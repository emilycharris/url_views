# url_views
Django URLs and Views homework

This assignment was completed as part of my work at The Iron Yard.

**Description**

"Wiring up" all of the moving parts within Django is daunting. Let's start small.

The urls.py, views.py, and templates are all part of a fragile house of cards within Django that if used properly can result in a wonderfully well functioning application, but if misused will result in a lot of confusion.

In this assignment we will also be using the Django Admin application to import our data.

**Objectives**
- Know how to connect a URL pattern to a view
- Know how to connect a template to a view
- Know how to access the Django admin with a super user account

**Deliverables (day 1)**
- An entire new Django application
- a url pattern that is connected to your views


**Normal Mode**

Create a new Django project / application that contains url patterns that route to associated views.

The patterns you are required to follow are:

/

/hello

/99/red/balloons

Be creative and add as many as you'd like.

In addition to having the urls defined in the project's urls.py file, you should also include a view that maps to a particular url. This view function should do nothing other than return a HttpResponse object and send a message to the browser.

In order to complete this assignment, I used Python and Django.
